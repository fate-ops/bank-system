# New Bank — m320 OOD Start Point

Start point (*Vorgabe*) for the **m320 Objektorientiertes Design** Bank exercise.

The focus of this project is **use-cases and sprints**: in each sprint one new part of the system is
designed and then implemented. You are not meant to build everything at once — work through
`docs/exercises/` in order.

---

## ⚠️ The build is red on purpose

```
Tests run: 19, Failures: 19, Errors: 0
```

**This is the intended starting condition, not a broken checkout.** Every test in `src/test/` is a
deliberate stub:

```java
@Test
@DisplayName("Simple deposit on SavingsAccount should work")
public void testDeposit() {
    fail("ToDo");
}
```

Your job is to replace each `fail("ToDo")` with a real test. `Failures: 19, Errors: 0` means all 19
stubs were found and ran correctly. If you ever see **`Errors`** instead of `Failures`, *that* is a
real problem — something no longer compiles or the test framework cannot start.

---

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** JDK 21 or newer. Maven is not required — the project ships the Maven wrapper
(`mvnw`), which downloads what it needs on first run.

```bash
# Get the code
git clone https://github.com/bbwlc/new-bank.git
cd new-bank

# Compile everything (main + tests)
./mvnw test-compile

# Run the test suite (expect 19 failures — see above)
./mvnw test

# Start the Spring Boot application on http://localhost:8080
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

On Windows use `mvnw.cmd` instead of `./mvnw`.

The application starts, but currently has **no REST endpoints** — every URL returns `404`. That is
correct: the web layer is built in Sprint 7. A clean startup looks like this:

```
Tomcat started on port 8080 (http) with context path '/'
Started NewBankApplication in 1.1 seconds
```

---

## Checking that the app is actually running

Since there are no REST endpoints yet, `404` on `http://localhost:8080/` does **not** mean the app is
broken. To check the app itself is up, use the built-in **Spring Boot Actuator** health endpoint
instead:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

A healthy app answers with `"status":"UP"`, plus a breakdown per component (database, disk space,
liveness/readiness):

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "components": {
    "db": { "status": "UP", "details": { "database": "H2" } },
    "diskSpace": { "status": "UP" },
    "livenessState": { "status": "UP" },
    "readinessState": { "status": "UP" }
  }
}
```

You can also just open `http://localhost:8080/actuator/health` in a browser. If the app hasn't
started yet, or crashed, you'll get "connection refused" instead of a response.

### Domain vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Millirappen** | The unit of all amounts. `100_000` = CHF 1.00 |
| **Buchung** / `Booking` | A single transaction. Withdrawals are stored as **negative** amounts |
| **Saldo** / balance | Current account balance |
| `Scheduled` | A transaction date, expressed as milliseconds-until-due |

---

## The sprints

Read `docs/exercises/start.md` first — it lists the full sequence. The briefs:

| Sprint | Brief | Topic |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | *(done — this repo)* | `Bank` + `Account` baseline |
| 2 | [`02-Exercise-bookings.md`](docs/exercises/02-Exercise-bookings.md) | Bookings; derive the balance from them |
| 3 | [`03-Exercise-specific-accounts.md`](docs/exercises/03-Exercise-specific-accounts.md) | Inheritance: `SalaryAccount`, `PromoYouthSavingsAccount` |
| 4 | [`04-Exercise-factory-pattern.md`](docs/exercises/04-Exercise-factory-pattern.md) | Factory pattern |
| 5 | [`05-Exercise-singleton-pattern.md`](docs/exercises/05-Exercise-singleton-pattern.md) | Singleton pattern + its trade-offs |
| 6–11 | [`01-Exercise-build-the-be.md`](docs/exercises/10-Exercise-build-the-be.md) | Spring Boot REST backend |

> **Note on numbering:** `01-Exercise-build-the-be.md` is the Spring Boot extension and belongs at
> the **end**, after sprints 2–5. It is numbered `01` for historical reasons.

## Scenarios: from requirement to use-case to code

`docs/scenarios/` contains the actual **requirement text** for each sprint, written as a short
story at the bank counter (German, one PDF per increment). This is the raw material — the exercise
briefs in `docs/exercises/` already distill it into tasks, but reading the original scenario first
is closer to how requirements actually arrive.

**Workflow for each sprint:**

1. **Read** the matching scenario PDF below — it tells you *who* wants *what*, in plain language.
2. **Draft a use-case** from it yourself: identify the actors, describe the use-case(s), sketch the
   class diagram. Do this before opening the exercise brief — that's the actual exercise.
3. **Compare** your use-case against the corresponding `docs/exercises/*.md` brief, then implement.

| Scenario PDF | Requirement (short) | Matches sprint |
|---|---|---|
| [`01_UML_Bank2.pdf`](docs/scenarios/01_UML_Bank2.pdf) | Customer opens an account, deposits, withdraws, gets a statement | 1 — baseline |
| [`03_UML_Bank3.pdf`](docs/scenarios/03_UML_Bank3.pdf) | Customer triggers a booking (date, amount) | 2 — Bookings |
| [`04_UML_Bank4a.pdf`](docs/scenarios/04_UML_Bank4a.pdf) | Three account types: salary, savings, youth savings (design) | 3 — Specific accounts |
| [`04_UML_Bank4b.pdf`](docs/scenarios/04_UML_Bank4b.pdf) | ...with credit limit / bonus rules, `TreeMap`-backed `Bank` (implement) | 3 — Specific accounts |
| [`04_UML_Bank4c.pdf`](docs/scenarios/04_UML_Bank4c.pdf) | Account id is no longer passed in — the bank generates it | 4 — Factory pattern |
| [`05_UML_Bank5.pdf`](docs/scenarios/05_UML_Bank5.pdf) | Bank staff list all accounts sorted by balance, top-5/bottom-5 | extra — reporting |
| [`06_UML_Bank6.pdf`](docs/scenarios/06_UML_Bank6.pdf) | Bank exposes `createSavingsAccount`/`createPromoYouthSavingsAccount`/`createSalaryAccount` | 4 — Factory pattern |
| [`07_UML_Bank7.pdf`](docs/scenarios/07_UML_Bank7.pdf) | Only one `Bank` instance may exist; a second attempt throws | 5 — Singleton pattern |

There is no scenario numbered `02` — the material jumps from `Bank2` to `Bank3`; that is a gap in
the source, not a missing file.

---

## Known gaps (deliberate)

These are not bugs to report — they are the exercises. Each is addressed by the sprint named.

| Gap | Where | Sprint |
|---|---|---|
| `Booking` has no `text`, so a statement cannot say *why* money moved | `Booking.java` | 2 |
| `Account` keeps `balance` as a field *and* a booking list — two sources of truth | `Account.java` | 2 |
| The booking list is write-only; there is no getter | `Account.java` | 2 |
| `createPromoYouthSavingsAccount()` and `createSalaryAccount()` both return a plain `SavingsAccount` | `AccountFactory.java` | 3 + 4 |
| `creditLimit` is accepted and silently discarded | `AccountFactory.java` | 3 + 4 |
| `Bank` is not a singleton | `Bank.java` | 5 |
| No controllers, DTOs or error handling | — | 7 + 10 |

`Bank.getAccount()` also throws `InvalidAmountException` for an unknown id, which is the wrong
exception type. Fixing that is fair game at any point.

## Tech stack

| | |
|---|---|
| Java | 21 (toolchain target) |
| Spring Boot | 4.1.0 |
| Build | Maven wrapper 3.6.3 |
| Web | `spring-boot-starter-webmvc` (the Boot 4 name for `starter-web`) |
| Persistence | `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` + H2 in-memory |
| Testing | `spring-boot-starter-test` — JUnit 5, AssertJ, Mockito, MockMvc |
| Monitoring | `spring-boot-starter-actuator` — health check at `/actuator/health` |

The database is **in-memory**: it is recreated on every start and gone when you stop the app.

Note that the domain classes (`Bank`, `Account`, …) are deliberately **not** Spring beans. They are
plain objects, so the OO design stands on its own. The service layer that wraps them in Spring
arrives in Sprint 6.
